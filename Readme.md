To get started, download the provided Phase 0 data. Use any tools or methods to develop your sales predictions and submit your CSV files within the submission period. During Phase 1, monitor your ranking on the leaderboard to see how you’re doing. You will also find a function designed to test a few simple forecasts, which you can use to get started. In each phase of the competition, participants will receive separate CSV files containing the following data: 

 

Sales Data (Phase X - Sales.csv): Number of weekly units sold.

 

Price Data (Phase X - Price.csv): The price CSV file lists product pricing information based on actual transactions. Note that you won’t see prices if there is no product transaction in a specific week. 

What is the expected prediction task?

Participants in this datathon are tasked with accurately forecasting future sales using historical sales, and pricing data provided. The goal is to develop robust predictive models that can anticipate sales trends for various products across different clients and warehouses. Submissions will be evaluated based on their accuracy and bias against actual sales figures. The competition is structured into two phases.
